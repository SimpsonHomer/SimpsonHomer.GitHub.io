  I am a third-year Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.<br /><br />
  My philosophical interests include philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophical semantics.  I am particularly interested in the philosophy of color, on which I am currently in the midst of completing my qualifying paper.<br /><br />
  I also have side interests in early modern philosophy and philosophy of religion.<br /><br />

  Before coming to UCSB, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy at
  Geneseo State University in New York with minors in linguistics and
  anthropology. Afterwards I took graduate courses in philosophy and linguistics at the University of Buffalo, SUNY for two years.<br /><br />

  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have worked in a number of
  industries, trying my hand at (among other things) marketing and web
  design. Currently, I maintain the <a
  href="http://www.philosophy.ucsb.edu">UCSB Philosophy website</a> and
  intern at <a
  href="http://graphics.msi.ucsb.edu/Oceanographics/">Ocean o' 
  Graphics</a>. See my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> for more information.<br /><br />
