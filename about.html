<div>
  I am a third-year Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</br></br>
  My philosophical interests include philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophical semantics.  I am particularly interested in the philosophy of color, on which I am currently in the midst of completing my qualifying paper.</br></br>
  I also have side interests in early modern philosophy and philosophy of religion.</br></br>

  Before coming to UCSB, I earned a Bachelor's of Arts in Philosophy at Geneseo State University in New York, and took graduate courses in philosophy and linguistics at the University of Buffalo, SUNY for two years.</br></br>

  In addition to my academic pursuits, I have worked in a number of industries, trying my hand at (among other things) marketing, web design, and biotechnology. Currently, I maintain the <a href="www.philosophy.ucsb.edu">UCSB Philosophy website</a> and intern at <a href="http://graphics.msi.ucsb.edu/Oceanographics/">Ocean o'Graphics</a>. See my resume for more information.</br></br>
