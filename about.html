  <p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
  <p>My philosophical interests include philosophy of mind,
  metaphysics, and philosophical semantics.  I am particularly
  interested in the philosophy of color, on which I'm writing my
  dissertation. I received my M.A. in Spring 2015, after completing my
  qualifying paper, a critical study of Jonathan Cohen's relational
  theory of color. My dissertation builds on this work in order to
  reject historically popular dispositional and relational theories of
  color, as well as reductive physicalist and anti-realist views about
  color. So, ultimately I defend a non-reductive realist view about
  color sometimes known as 'primitivism'.</p>

  <p>Before coming to UCSB, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy at
  Geneseo State University in New York with minors in linguistics and
  anthropology. Afterwards I took graduate courses in philosophy and linguistics at the University of Buffalo, SUNY for two years.</p>
