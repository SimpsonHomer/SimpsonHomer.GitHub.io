      <h3><i>A Twitter bot that tweets pictures of chihuahuas and corgis!</i></h3>
        <p>Too many depressing current events and awful "Weird Twitter" jokes cropping up on your Twitter feed? Electrify your timeline with some pictures of chihuahuas and Welsh corgis, courtesy of chicorgibot! This is my first Twitter bot, written in Python using the <a href="#">tweepy</a> library. It tweets a random picture from the chihuahua or corgi subreddit every fifteen minutes.</p>

  <h1><a href="#">Using Logic 2010 for Philosophy 183</a></h1>
  <h3><i>A user's guide for an educational logic program!</i></h3>
  <p>In the Spring of 2015 I was teaching assistant for Philosophy 183, Beginning Modern Logic. The software that the students were required to use for their homework assignments was Logic 2010, a useful program, but one with a steep learning curve and limited documentation. So, I wrote my own documentation, tailored for the needs of a Philosophy 183 student.</p>

  <h3><i>Instructions for dogsitting!</i></h3>
    <p>Every dog has its peculiarities and its own special needs. This document details those of my own canine daughter, Ruth. If you ever find Ruth in your care, this manual will guide you in providing her with a safe, comfortable temporary home.</p>

  <h1><a href="#">My Qualifying Paper</a></h1>
  <h3><i>The paper that got me a Master's degree!</i></h3>
  <p>In the Spring of 2014, I wrote my qualifying paper, "Color Relationalism and Perceptual Error". It passed, and I was awarded an M.A. and a C.Phil in Philosophy from UCSB. There are probably five people in the world at most who will find the paper interesting, so for those five people, here it is.</p>
