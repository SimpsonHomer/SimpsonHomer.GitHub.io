<h1>Chapter 1 Problems</h1>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>Parsing problems in Chapter 1 require you to determine whether some string of symbols is a sentence of the language of Kalish, Montague, and Mar, and whether it is correct according to the official notation, or correct by informal convention.</p>
<p>To complete parsing problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu, select 'Parsing'.</li>
<li>A new window will pop up with a menu at the bottom. Click 'Select'.</li>
<li>In the 'Problems' window, select a problem.</li>
<li>On the left hand side of your window, there will be a menu with three options, 'Official Notation', 'Informal Notation', and 'Not Well Formed'. On the right, you will find a string of symbols.</li>
<li>If the string of symbols has a negation sign that is not contained in any set of parentheses, click on it. If the string is a well-formed negation, then the negation sign will blink green and the corresponding unnegated sentence will appear below it. If it is not a well-formed negation, then it is either an informally-correct conditional or it is not well-formed.</li>
<li>If the string of symbols has a conditional arrow that is not contained by any parentheses, or contained only by one set of parentheses, click on it. If the string is a well-formed conditional, then the arrow will blink green and the antecedent and consequent will appear below the it.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 5 and 6 for the resulting sentences.</li>
<li>If all remaining bottom-most sentences are atomic, you are finished parsing the sentence. If the sentence is a conditional, but is not contained by parentheses, click 'Official Notation'. Otherwise, click 'Unofficial Notation'. </li>
<li>If neither steps 5 nor 6 could be carried out, click 'Not Well Formed'.</li>
<li>Click 'Check' or use keyboard shortcut to confirm that your work is correct and complete.</li>
</ol>
