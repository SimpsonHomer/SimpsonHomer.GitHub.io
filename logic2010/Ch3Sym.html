<h1>Chapter 3 Problems</h1>
<h3>Symbolization</h3>
<p>Symbolization problems in Chapter 3 require you to translate a natural language sentence into any of the sentence types from Chapter 2, as well as universal and existential generalizations.</p>
<p>In Chapter 3 new symbols are introduced to the language: the universal and existential quantifiers, predicates, variables, and constants. In addition to generalizations, atomic sentences can be constructed in a new way, by placing a predicate letter next to a constant or variable.</p>
<p>To complete symbolization problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat steps 1-4 from Chapter 1 Symbolizations.</li>
<li>In your work frame there will be a cell with text in it. Click and hit return (alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts). You will be presented with the eight options from Chapter 2, as well as 'Universal Generalization' and 'Existential Generalization'. Choose one of the sentence types if you believe the sentence to be of one of those types; if you aren't sure, click 'hint'.</li>
<li>The steps for 'Negation', 'Conditional', and 'Atomic' are as in Chapter 1. The steps for 'Conjunction', 'Disjunction', and 'Biconditional' are as in Chapter 2.</li>
<li>If you previously entered 'Universal Generalization', you will be asked to symbolize the formula that occurs within the scope of the universal quantifier. The formula could be atomic, a negation, conditional, biconditional, conjunction, disjunction, or another generalization. Take the appropriate step depending on which type of sentence it is.</li>
<li>If you previously entered 'Existential Generalization', you will be asked to symbolize the formula that occurs within the scope of the existential quantifier. Proceed as you would in the above step.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps until the entire natural language sentence has been symbolized in symbolic terms.</li>
<li>Click 'check' on the menu at the bottom of the window, or use keyboard shortcuts.</li>
</ol>
