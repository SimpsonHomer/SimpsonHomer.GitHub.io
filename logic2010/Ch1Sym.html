<h1>Chapter 1 Problems</h1>
<h3>Symbolization</h3>
<p>Symbolization problems in Chapter 1 require you to translate a natural language sentence into an atomic sentence, a negation, or a conditional in the formal language of Kalish, Montague, and Mar.  </p>
<p>A negation might be the negation of an atomic sentence, a negation, or a conditional. A conditional might have an atomic sentence, a negation, or a conditional for its antecedent or consequent.  </p>
<p>To complete symbolization problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu, select 'Symbolization'.</li>
<li>A new window will pop up with a menu at the bottom. Click on 'Select'.</li>
<li>In the 'Problems' window, choose a problem.</li>
<li>The problem window will split into three frames. The left frame contains translations of natural language sentences into atomic sentences that may appear in your symbolization. The top right frame initially contains the sentence you are translating, but will contain your symbolization in progress. The bottom right frame is one you will work in.</li>
<li>In your work frame there will be a cell with text in it. Click and hit return (alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts). You will be presented with five options: truncate (which we will not use in this course), negation, conditional, atomic, and hint. Click one of the first three if you believe the sentence to be of one of those types; if you aren't sure, click 'hint'.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Negation', you will now be asked to enter the sentence that has been negated. If that sentence is a negation, click 'Negation' again (or use keyboard shortcuts) and repeat this step. If it is a conditional, click 'Conditional' and proceed to step 7. If it is an atomic sentence, skip to step 8.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Conditional', you will now be asked to enter the antecedent and consequent of the conditional. If the antecedent is a negation, see step 6. If it is a conditional, repeat step 7. If it is an atomic sentence, see step 8. Likewise for the consequent.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Atomic', you will now be asked to enter the correct atomic sentence letter to symbolize this portion of the sentence. Enter the sentence letter.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps until the entire natural language sentence has been symbolized in terms of negation symbols, conditional arrows, and atomic sentences letters.</li>
<li>Click 'check' on the menu at the bottom of the window, or use keyboard shortcuts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Students find it helpful to copy and paste sentence fragments into new cells as they break complex sentences down into their components. The normal cut, copy, and paste shortcuts, Command-X, Command-C, and Command-V, do not work in Logic 2010. Instead, students should use Control-X, Control-C, and Control-V, respectively.</p>
