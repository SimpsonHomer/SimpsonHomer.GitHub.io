<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Welcome! This is a user's guide for Logic 2010 as used in Philosophy 183 at UCSB. The guide focuses only on those sorts of problem that will be assigned for homework in PHIL 183, including symbolization, parsing, derivations, truth tables, and recognizing rules. Like your textbook, each chapter presupposes knowledge of the previous chapters, so it is best to consult each chapter in sequential order.</p>
<p>Note that this is not a guidebook for <em>doing derivations</em> or any other sort of problem you'll be asked to do in PHIL 183. The purpose of this guide is to help you learn how to use Logic 2010 to aid you in practicing the techniques you'll be expected to master in order to do well in the course. In the process, I will sometimes explain derivation strategies (as in the case of, e.g., indirect and conditional derivations), and at other points, I will assume some background knowledge. For instance, when explaining how to derive a disjunction, it is assumed that you have proven theorems 45 and 46 and have access to derived rule CDJ.</p>
<p>I hope you find this user's guide helpful as you begin to learn formal logic and how to use Logic 2010!</p>
