<h1>Chapter 2 Problems</h1>
<h3>Symbolization</h3>
<p>Symbolization problems in Chapter 2 require you to translate a natural language sentence into any of the sentence types from Chapter 1, as well as conjunctions, disjunctions, and biconditionals.</p>
<p>A conjunction or disjunction might be the conjunction or disjunction of an atomic sentence, a negation, a conditional, a conjunction, a disjunction, or a biconditional with another of any of those sorts of sentence. A biconditional might have any of these sorts of sentence for its antecedent or consequent.  </p>
<p>To complete symbolization problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Repeat steps 1-4 from Chapter 1 Symbolizations.</li>
<li>In your work frame there will be a cell with text in it. Click and hit return (alternatively, use keyboard shortcuts). You will be presented with the five options from Chapter 1, as well as 'Conjunction', 'Disjunction', and 'Biconditional'. Choose one of the sentence types if you believe the sentence to be of one of those types; if you aren't sure, click 'hint'.</li>
<li>The steps for 'Negation', 'Conditional', and 'Atomic' are as in Chapter 1.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Conjunction', you will be asked to enter each conjunct. Click on the left cell, press 'Enter', and select the type of sentence the left conjunct is, then do the same for the right conjunct. For each conjunct, if it is a negation, conditional, or atomic sentence, refer to the directions from Chapter 1 to continue symbolization. If either is a conjunction, refer again to step 4. If either is a disjunction, refer to step 5. If either is a biconditional, refer to step 6.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Disjunction', you will be asked to enter each disjunct. The process is similar to entering conjuncts as described in step 4.</li>
<li>If you previously selected 'Biconditional', you will be asked to enter the sentence on each side of the biconditional double arrow. The process is similar to entering conjuncts as described in step 4.</li>
<li>Repeat these steps until the entire natural language sentence has been symbolized in symbolic terms.</li>
<li>Click 'check' on the menu at the bottom of the window, or use keyboard shortcuts.</li>
</ol>
