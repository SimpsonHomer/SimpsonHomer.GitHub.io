<h1>Chapter 2 Problems</h1>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>Parsing problems in Chapter 2 are similar to those in Chapter 1, but require you to parse conjunctions, disjunctions, and biconditionals as well.</p>
<p>Due to the informal convention that a set of parentheses may be dropped on either side of a biconditional and in the antecedent or consequent of a conditional, steps 3 and 4 should always be performed before step 5.</p>
<p>To complete parsing problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform steps 1-4 of the instructions from Chapter 1 Parsing.</li>
<li>Negations are treated as in Chapter 1. If a negation sign occurs in the sentence outside of any pair of parentheses but is not a well-formed negation, then it is either informally-correct sentence of some other type, or it is not well-formed.</li>
<li>If the string of symbols has a biconditional double arrow not contained by any parentheses, or contained only by one set of parentheses, click on it. If the string is a well-formed biconditional, then the arrow will blink green and each side of the biconditional will appear below it.</li>
<li>Conditionals are treated as in Chapter 1.</li>
<li>If the string of symbols has a conjunction or disjunction sign not contained by any parentheses, or contained only by one set of parentheses, click on it. If the string is a well-formed is a well formed conjunction or disjunction, then the sign will blink green and each conjunct or disjunct will appear below it.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2, 3, 4, and 5 for the resulting sentences.</li>
<li>If all remaining bottom-most sentences are atomic, you are finished parsing the sentence. If the sentence is a negation, click 'Official Notation'. If the sentence is not a negation and is contained by parentheses, click 'Official Notation'. Otherwise, click 'Unofficial Notation'. </li>
<li>If none of steps 2, 3, 4, or 5 could be carried out, click 'Not Well Formed'.</li>
<li>Click 'Check' or use keyboard shortcut to confirm that your work is correct and complete.</li>
</ol>
