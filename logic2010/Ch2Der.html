<h1>Chapter 2 Problems</h1>
<h3>Derivations</h3>
<p>We begin derivations as in Chapter 1.</p>
<p>Indirect and Conditional derivations proceed as in Chapter 1.</p>
<h4>Deriving Biconditionals</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Cond' in the center cell. Select the conditional you would like to derive first.</li>
<li>Give a subderivation of the conditional using the directions for conditional derivation from Chapter 1.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Cond' in the center cell. Select the conditional you have not yet derived.</li>
<li>Give a subderivation of the conditional using the directions for conditional derivation from Chapter 1.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the numbers of the show lines for each of the conditionals you have derived in the center cell separated by spaces, and then enter the letters 'CB', separated by another space.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the number of the previous line, a space, and the letters 'DD'.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deriving Conjunctions</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Conj' in the center cell. Select the conjunct you would like to derive first.</li>
<li>Give a subderivation of the conjunct appropriate for the type of sentence it is.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Conj' in the center cell. Select the conjunct you have not yet derived.</li>
<li>Give a subderivation of the conjunct appropriate for the type of sentence it is.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the numbers of the show lines for each of conjuncts you derived in the center cell separated by spaces, and then enter the letters 'ADJ', separated by another space. Press 'Enter' and select the conjunction you are trying to derive.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the number of the previous line, a space, and the letters 'DD' in the center cell.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Deriving Disjunctions</h4>
<p>(Note: these instructions assume you have proven theorem 45 and have access to derived rule CDJ, in order to use our preferred strategy for deriving disjunctions.)</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Corr' in the center cell.</li>
<li>Give a subderivation of the corresponding conditional of the disjunction.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the number of the show line for the corresponding condition in the center cell, a space, and the letters 'CDJ'.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter the number of the previous line, a space, and the letters 'DD' in the center cell.</li>
</ol>
