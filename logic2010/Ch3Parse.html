<h1>Chapter 3 Problems</h1>
<h3>Parsing</h3>
<p>Parsing problems in Chapter 3 are similar to those in Chapter 2, but require you to parse universal and existential generalizations, as well.</p>
<p>To complete parsing problems:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perform steps 1-4 of the instructions from Chapter 1 Parsing.</li>
<li>Negations are treated as in Chapter 2. If a negation sign occurs in the sentence outside of any pair of parentheses, <em>and outside the scope of any quantifier</em>, but is not a well-formed negation, then it is either informally-correct sentence of some other type, or it is not well-formed.</li>
<li>Biconditionals are treated as in Chapter 2.</li>
<li>Conditionals are treated as in Chapter 1.</li>
<li>If the sentence consists of a formula that occurs entirely within the scope of a universal or existential quantifier, click on the quantifier. If the sentence is a well-formed generalization, the quantifier will blink green and the formula, aside from the quantifier, will appear below the sentence.</li>
<li>Conjunctions and disjunctions are treated as in Chapter 2.</li>
<li>If the sentence consists of a predicate and either a constant or a variable, click on the predicate. It will blink green and the constant or variable will appear below the formula.</li>
<li>Repeat steps 2 through 7 for the resulting sentences.</li>
<li>If all remaining bottom-most sentences are sentence letters, constants, or variables, you are finished parsing the sentence. If the sentence is a negation or generalization, click 'Official Notation'. If the sentence is neither and is contained by parentheses, click 'Official Notation'. Otherwise, click 'Unofficial Notation'. </li>
<li>If none of steps 2 through 7 could be carried out, click 'Not Well Formed'.</li>
<li>Click 'Check' or use keyboard shortcut to confirm that your work is correct and complete.</li>
</ol>
