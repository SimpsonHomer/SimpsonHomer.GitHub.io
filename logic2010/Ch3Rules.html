<h1>Chapter 3 Problems</h1>
<h3>Recognizing Rules</h3>
<p>These problems are relatively straightforward. You will be presented with two sentences. Suppose that the first sentence occurs on a line in a derivation. Is there a rule you could cite that would allow you to write the second on a further line in your derivation? If so, write the abbreviation for that rule. If not, write, 'None'.</p>
