<h1>Chapter 1 Problems</h1>
<h3>Derivations</h3>
<p>In Chapter 1 you will be asked to derive atomic sentences, negations, and conditionals. In general, the most straightforward way to derive the former two sorts of sentence is to give an indirect derivation, and the most straightforward way to derive a conditional is by conditional derivation.  </p>
<p>Note that for some derivations, certain methods will be disabled. In these cases, you may have to improvise methods alternative to the ones listed here.</p>
<p>To begin a derivation:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the main menu, select 'Derivation.'</li>
<li>A new window will pop up with a menu at the bottom. Click 'Select'.</li>
<li>In the 'Problems' window, select a problem.</li>
<li>Your window will now contain two cells: one with the number of the derivation and a list of premises and conclusions, and a second, empty cell. Make a new line by pressing 'Enter' or using a keyboard shortcut. You will see three cells.</li>
<li>In the center cell, type 'Show Conc'. This will create a show line for the conclusion of the argument. If it is an atomic sentence or a negation, follow the directions for indirect derivation. If it is a conditional sentence, follow the directions for a conditional derivation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Indirect Derivations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'ASS ID' in the center cell.</li>
<li>For each new line, if you wish to enter a premise, enter 'PRx' in the center cell, with x substituted by the number of the premise, counting from left to right in the top left cell.</li>
<li>For each new line, if you wish to use an inference rule, write each line number you wish to cite in the center cell, separated by one space, and then the abbreviation for the inference rule separated by a space. 4. When citing an inference rule, you may cite a premise instead of a line by entering the premise in the above-mentioned way.</li>
<li>Once you have derived a sentence and its negation, make a new line and put the line number of each sentence in the center cell, separated by a space, following by the letters 'ID'. Press 'Enter' to box and cancel, and complete your derivation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Conditional Derivations</h4>
<ol>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'ASS CD' in the center cell.</li>
<li>Make a new line and enter 'Show Cons' in the center cell.</li>
<li>If the consequent is an atomic sentence or negation, follow the directions for indirect derivation in order to give a subderivation of the sentence. If the sentence is a conditional, give a subderivation of the sentence following the current set of directions from step 1. When you have completed either process, proceed to step 4.</li>
<li>Once you have derived the consequent of the sentence, make a new line and cite the line number of the consequent and the letters 'CD' separated by a space. Press 'Enter' to box and cancel, and complete your derivation.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Subderivations</h4>
<p>In order to give a conditional derivation, you must assume the antecedent and derive the consequent. In effect, this means you have to do a second derivation in the process of doing a conditional derivation. This second derivation, nested inside the first, is a subderivation. If the consequent is an atomic sentence or negation, your subderivation will be indirect. If the consequent is itself a conditional, then your subderivation will be a conditional derivation and require yet <em>another</em> subderivation, which, if conditional, will require another subderivation, and so forth. So step 3 of the instructions for conditional derivations must refer to those instructions, as well as those of indirect derivations.</p>
