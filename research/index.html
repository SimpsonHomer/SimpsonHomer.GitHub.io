	<h2>An Argument for Color Realism <i>In Progress</i></h1>
	<p>The claim is sometimes made by philosophers, psychologists, and others that colors are not 'real' features of the world, but creations of the mind. I argue to the contrary by comparing color perception to perception of geometrical features such as shape, size, and distance. Since there is no relevant difference between the perception of such environmental features and the perception of color, by parity of reasoning, we ought to accept that color perception is no more or less reliable than these other forms of visual perception. So to deny the reality of color, to maintain that color perception is systematically misleading, rationally commits one to deny the reality of such properties as shape, size, and distance. Anyone who finds this consequence absurd should reject claims that color is not real, and accept that color perception is as reliable as the perception of shape, size, and distance.</p>

	<h2>A Cognitive Mechanism to Vindicate Relational Theories of Color? <i>In Progress</i></h1>
	<p>Relational theories of color claim that colors are relational properties of surfaces, typically with perceivers and viewing conditions as relata. Naturalistically-oriented relational theories face the problem of integrating their metaphysics with a representational perceptual psychology, and in particular to give an account how the visual system comes to represent such relational properties on the basis of the information given in the retinal image. Jonathan Cohen proposes that the visual system represents relational color properties because it can represent counterfactual appearance properties: a surface S has color C in viewing condition V for perceiver P just in case, were P to observe S in V, S would look C-ish to P. In this paper, I show how variations on Cohen's proposed visual mechanism could underwrite color cognition according to various relational theories. I will then argue that this "counterfactualist" approach to understanding color perception commits us to an odd sort of explanation of the biological function of color vision. Rather than perceiving some feature of the environment that it is evolutionarily advantageous for us to have cognitive access to, color perception tracks the state of one's own visual experience throughout changes in illumination. This capacity could only be evolutionarily advantageous if the features of visual experience the visual system is concerned with are reliably correlated with external environmental features that it is advantageous for an organism to have cognitive access to. As a consequence, such a theory about color perception adds needless complications to an account of the function of color perception. Why not hold that color perception tracks external feature of the environment directly? If this simpler alternative is available, it ought to be preferred, and consequently we should abandon color relationalism.</p>
