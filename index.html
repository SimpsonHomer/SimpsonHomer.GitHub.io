  <h1><a href="logic2010/">Using Logic 2010 for Philosophy 183</a></h1>
  <h3><i>A user's guide for an educational logic program!</i></h3>
  <p>In the Spring of 2015 I was teaching assistant for Philosophy 183, Beginning Modern Logic. The software that the students were required to use for their homework assignments was Logic 2010, a useful program, but one with a steep learning curve and limited documentation. So, I wrote my own documentation, tailored for the needs of a Philosophy 183 student.</p>

  <h1><a href="ColorRelationalismPerceptualError.pdf">My Qualifying Paper</a></h1>
  <h3><i>The paper that got me a Master's degree!</i></h3>
  <p>In the Spring of 2014, I wrote my qualifying paper, "Color Relationalism and Perceptual Error". It passed, and I was awarded an M.A. and a C.Phil in Philosophy from UCSB. There are probably five people in the world at most who will find the paper interesting, so for those five people, here it is.</p>
