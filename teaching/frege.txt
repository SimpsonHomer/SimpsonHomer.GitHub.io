\section{Frege's Puzzle}

Frege opens \emph{On Sinn and Bedeutung} with a puzzle about identity, or `sameness'. He asks us about the following sorts of statements:

\begin{itemize}
\item{a = a}
\item{a = b}
\end{itemize}

The former sort is logically trivial and knowable /emph{a priori}, as statements of this form merely state of some object that it is self-identical; they are tautologies, the denials of which are logical contradictions.

The latter sort, however, are putatively informative and for the most part knowable online \emph{a posteriori}.

Question: \emph{What example does Frege give here as a `fertile discovery' of the form a = b?}

The puzzle is this: why, if two statement `a = a' and `a = b' are about the same thing (the thing that is called both `a' and `b'), is one trivial and the other informative?

An earlier answer that Frege gave was that identity statements are not about things, but about names. On this view, `a = a' means that `a' names the same thing as itself, and `a = b' means that `a' and `b' name the same thing. He now rejects this view.

Questions: \emph{How does Frege's earlier view resolve his puzzle? What is Frege's argument against the old view?}

\section{\emph{Sinn} and \emph{Bedeutung}}

Frege proposes that there are two components to the meaning of any phrase: its sense(\emph{Sinn}) and its reference(\emph{Bedeutung}). The reference of a phrase is what it stands for, while the sense is a `mode of presentation' of the thing stood for.

Two phrases may have distinct senses, while having the same reference. At section 27, Frege gives two examples of cases in which this occurs.

Questions: \emph{What two examples does Frege give? For each example, what do you think accounts for the difference in sense of each phrase?}

Grasping the sense of a phrase is simply a matter of understanding one's language sufficiently well. Fully grasping the reference of a phrase would require knowing of everything in the world, whether it was part of the reference of the phrase.

One and the same sense may be expressible with many different phrases in different languages. In addition, the same sense may be expressible in the same language by synonyms.
