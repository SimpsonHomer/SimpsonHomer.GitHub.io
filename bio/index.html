	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<p>I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in philosophy at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p>
	<p>My philosophical interests include philosophy of mind, metaphysics, and philosophical semantics. I am particularly interested in the philosophy of color, on which I'm writing my dissertation. I received my M.A. in Spring 2015, after completing my qualifying paper, a critical study of Jonathan Cohen's relational theory of color. My dissertation builds on this work in order to reject historically popular dispositional and relational theories of color, as well as reductive physicalist and anti-realist views about color. So, ultimately I defend a non-reductive realist view about color sometimes known as 'primitivism'.</p>
	<p>Before coming to UCSB, I earned a Bachelor of Arts in Philosophy at Geneseo State University in New York with minors in linguistics and anthropology. Afterwards I took graduate courses in philosophy and linguistics at the University of Buffalo, SUNY for two years.</p>
	<p>In addition to philosophy, I am interested in web and information design, and some forms of technical writing. See my <a href="../resume/" target="_blank">resume</a> for information about my non-academic work history.</p>
